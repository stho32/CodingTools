# CodingTools
My standard coding tools, command line programs that I need on every computer

There are some tools that I need for a complete dev computer setup. 
I need them in my path and I need a few modifications on their configuration.

To make sure I can synchronize them on every computer I use, here comes "CodingTools".

CodingTools at this moment contains:
  - nuget v. 4.7.0
  - msbuild 2015 (=v14)
  
To set things up, clone the repo and set your path to contain the folder.
Run provided installers as needed.
